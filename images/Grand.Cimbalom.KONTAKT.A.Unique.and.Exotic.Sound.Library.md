# Grand Cimbalom KONTAKT: A Unique and Exotic Sound Library
 
If you are looking for a new and distinctive sound for your music production, you might want to check out Grand Cimbalom KONTAKT by Spitfire Audio. This is a sample library of a concert hammered dulcimer, a type of chordophone composed of a large, trapezoidal box with metal strings stretched across its top. The cimbalom is a musical instrument popularized in Hungary and commonly found throughout central and eastern Europe. It is played by striking two beaters against the strings, producing a rich and resonant sound.

Grand Cimbalom KONTAKT features Greg Knowles playing his Grand Cimbalom in the hall at Air Studios, London, one of the greatest recording studios in the world[^1^] [^2^]. The library was recorded with four mic positions (Close, Tree, Ambient, Outriggers) and offers two dynamics and four round robins for each note. You can also choose between two pedal modes: Piano (where pedal down sustains the sound) or Cimbalom (where pedal up sustains the sound). The library also includes the characteristic tremolando technique, which creates a shimmering effect on the strings.
 
The cimbalom has been used in many film scores and music genres over the years, such as John Barry's The Ipcress File and The Persuaders[^1^], or Portishead's Sour Times[^1^] [^2^]. It can be used as a featured or solo instrument, or as a textural element to add depth and color to your mix. It works well with pianos, harps, strings, and other tuned percussion instruments. It can also create a variety of moods and atmospheres, from mournful and exotic to lively and playful.
