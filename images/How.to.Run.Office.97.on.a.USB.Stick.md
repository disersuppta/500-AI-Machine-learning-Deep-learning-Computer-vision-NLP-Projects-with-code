Office 97 Portable is not an official product from Microsoft, but rather a fan-made project that uses the files from the Office 97 CD-ROM. You can download it from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/office97standard_201912), where you can also find the original Office 97 Standard Edition[^1^]. You will need a USB stick with at least 500 MB of free space to copy the files.
